        <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gasses from coal burning has made China very polluted.  Of 70 cities the air quality tested by Ministry of Environmental Protection in China only 8 met the standards for air quality.  Safe air quality in PM2.5 is under 25 micrograms per cubic meter and in Beijing the PM2.5 is at over 600 micrograms per cubic meter.</p>
        <h2>Causes of problem</h2>
        <p>The reason for all the coal-burning is the population.  China is the most populated country in the world, and the easiest way to provide energy to over a billion people is to burn coal. The cause of all the air pollution in China is coal burning to create energy.  Many coal energy plants in China pollute the air to dangerous levels.  In 2013 China burned 4.2 billion metric tons of coal.  China is the largest emmiter in the world. All this coal pollution creates a smog that hangs over many cities in China.  This smog makes solar panels 20% less efective as the smog is blocking a lot of the sun.  This is another challenge for renewable energy and a reason why China uses so much coal energy.  </p>

        <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>Over 1.6 million people die a year from complications due to the heavy smog and air pollution.  Heavy smog lies over the cities, it looks like fog but it is very harmful to the respiratory system.  Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing, all cities in China have severe air pollution which causes children to acquire illnesses such as asthma, cardiovascular cancer and other troubling diseases. Every day 4,400 people die from problems caused by the unsafe air.  China has the highest rate of death from air pollution in the world.
        Around one-third of all who die from air pollution lived in China.
        </p>
        <h2>Solutions being implemented</h2>
        <p>China created the worlds biggest dam to provide sustainable hydroelectricity.  Also the country implemented a rule to lessen the amount of factories operating in the winter to reduce coal emissions.   China put restriction on Beijing.  Beijing needed to cut down it´s coal pollution by 50% from 2013 to 2018.  Beijing succeded and the air quality is substantially improved.  The restrictions prevented new coal-burning plants from opening.   China has a goal of minimizing its energy gained from burning coal to a 1,100 gigawatts by the year 2020.  </p>
