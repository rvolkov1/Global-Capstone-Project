        <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gasses from coal burning has made China very polluted.  Of 70 cities the air quality tested by Ministry of Environmental Protection in China only 8 met the standards for air quality.  Safe air quality in PM2.5 is under 25 micrograms per cubic meter and in Beijing the PM2.5 is at over 600 micrograms per cubic meter.</p>
        <h2>Causes of problem</h2>
        <p>The Chinese government to solve the problem decided to create a dam to solve the problem.  This dam is highly controversial as it creates almost as many problems as it solves.  The cause of all the air pollution in China is coal burning to create energy.  Many coal energy plants in China pollute the air to dangerous levels.  In 2013 China burned 4.2 billion metric tons of coal.   </p>

        <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>Over 1.6 million people die a year from complications due to the heavy smog and air pollution.  Heavy smog lies over the cities, it looks like fog but it is very harmful to the respiratory system. Every day 4,400 people die from problems caused by the unsafe air.  China has the highest rate of death from air pollution in the world
        About one-third of all who die from air pollution live in China.
        </p>
        <h2>Solutions being implemented</h2>
        <p>China created the worlds biggest dam to provide sustainable hydroelectricity.  Also the country implemented a rule to lessen the amount of factories operating in the winter to reduce coal emissions.   China put restriction on Beijing.  Beijing needed to cut down it´s coal pollution from 2013 to 2018.  Beijing succeded and the air quality is substantially improved.  The restrictions prevented new coal-burning plants from opening.   China has a goal of minimizing its energy gained from burning coal to a 1,100 gigawatts by the year 2020.  </p>
