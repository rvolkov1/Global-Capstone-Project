      <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
      <p>In Delhi, India, the air pollution is historically bad. A major cause of this is unclean power for the massive population.
      </p>
      <h2>Causes of problem</h2>
      <p>Many people do not have power, and use cooking fires and stuff like that to warm their homes and cook. With sustainable power, they will no longer need these fires. Another major cause is coal burning power plants that supply India’s power. These cause fumes and other things to go into the air. Another major factor in this is the amount of coal in India. They produce 382 million tons of coal per year, up more than 500% from 1970, with only 70 million tons a year. As a clear result of that, the main power source of India is coal. They also have one of the highest increasing populations in the world, and at 1.324 billion people, account for 19% of the worlds population.</p>

      <h2>Effects</h2>
      <p>The air pollution has disastrous effects in Delhi. Breathing there is like smoking 50 cigarettes. This pollution has caused multi car pileups due to lack of visibility and every minute, 2 people die from things related to air pollution. The air pollution has gotten so bad at times that the Indian Governement has had to close 4000 schools because the fumes have gotten so bad. The Indian Government has responded by closing several industrial coal burning power plants, but have not yet developed a sustainable long term plan. The most likely reason for this is the politics. In keeping coal, they are more likely to profit from it in selling it to the power companies</p>
      <h2>Solutions being implemented</h2>
      <p>India is working towards more clean air, but the Indian government has not yet come up with any lasting solutions.
