        <h2>Basic Facts</h2>
        <p>The US consumes substantial amounts of energy. It consumed 3.82 billion kilowatts of energy and is a leading polluter due to its huge use of fossil fuels. It might not have a population the size of China or India but its citizens abuse and overuse the energy that is provided.
        </p>
        <h2>Causes of problem</h2>
        <p>The U.S has a relatively large population and consumes a ton of oil and energy. In 2017, the United States consumed a total of 7.26 billion barrels of petroleum products, an average of about 19.88 million barrels per day. The US alone uses twenty percent of the world's oil. The problem is over the amount of materials we use to fuel the population some of them are running out, for example coal. In 2016, U.S. coal production decreased 18.8% year-over-year to 728.4 million short tons (MMst), the lowest annual production level since 1979. On top of that, the productive capacity of U.S. coal mines was 1,068 MMst, a decline of 8.3% from the 2015 levels. We are also running out of oil which is the other main source of energy our society depends on.

        <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>68% of  carbon emissions in 2017 were from coal because that’s the main power America uses. In the past the coal industry was a huge money maker and energy generator. We came to rely on it. The U.S is trying to switch to green energy to slowly. Natural gas was 30% of energy generated in 2017 and 81% came from fossil fuels(Coal,oil,natural gas). Most buildings run on natural gas or electricity and it’s been that way for decades.</p>
        <h2>Solutions being implemented</h2>
        <p>$30 million to support 35 projects in 16 states in 2017 to coal town that needed help. In 2016, renewable energy sources accounted for about 10% of total U.S. energy consumption and about 15% of electricity generation. The country and people of America are switching to green energy by using solar panels and driving green cars such as Tesla’s. Companies in the USA are switching to and advocating for green energy as well. For example Apples stores are mainly green and Intel has made a complete switch to 100% green energy.</p>
