        <p>In order for countries with large populations and fast-growing economies to achieve a more sustainable energy source and minimize air pollution, they need to use less fossil fuel energy like burning coal and more renewable energy like solar, wind or hydroelectric energy.   Coal is running out, it is estimated that by 2088 the world will run out of coal.  In 2013 China burned 4.2 billion metric tons of coal and eighty percent of its energy consumption came from energy generated by burning coal.  Their country is very dependent on an energy source that is unsustainable, nonrenewable and pollutes a lot.  The Chinese government is trying to convert to sustainable means of energy generation but they are running into a few issues.  The smog from the polluted air is so bad that solar panels are twenty percent less effective.  Also, China created a big dam to generate hydroelectricity but it displaced a lot of people and a lot of energy is lost when transferred long distances like to the east coast of China.  Unlike coal, the sun, wind, running water or the heat from the planet itself will not go away permanently ever.  So, in the long run, it is much better for the planet and for us humans to convert to renewable energy means.  Even if it is not as profitable in the short term.  With over two billion people worldwide without energy, the task of bringing energy to rural villages can be expensive and inefficient.  Instead renewable energy like wind or solar could be invaluable to the village.  There would be no need to stretch power lines over hundreds of miles to reach a village when the energy would be generated on the spot.  Since the sun and the wind are natural and very unlikely to end in the next million years, the energy would be sustainable, renewable and clean.  This energy would be much better for the village and the environment as it would allow people to cook food without having to burn anything which releases polluting gases.  Between 2016 and 2018 coal costs have grown while renewable energy has dropped in cost fifty percent.  It is now twenty percent cheaper to generate wind or solar energy than to get energy from coal.  Not to mention the added cost of health care once the coal burning pollutes the environment and gets people sick.  Since wind, solar and hydroelectric energy are more sustainable than burning coal or other fossil fuels.  Coal is very harmful to the environment and the human body it is best to generate energy from renewable means rather than coal.  For those reasons, governments should convert to renewable sources of energy.  Also in recent years, it has become less expensive to get energy from sustainable means than coal.  Countries should use wind, hydroelectric or other renewable sources of energy as their main source of energy.
