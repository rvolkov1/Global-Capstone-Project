        <h2>The Indian Government</h2>
        <p>The government of India does not want change to the sources of power in India because India is a major producer of coal.  If they were to change the source of power, they wouldn’t be able to sell the coal they produced to the power companies. This would decrease the GDP of their country.
        To address the problem, The government has regulated the burning of trash and car emissions, which has made the air quality slightly better. However, India has not made any restrictions on coal power plants.

        <h2>China</h2>
        <p>The Chinese government is affected negatively by the air pollution People in their country are dying from the coal-polluted air at a rate of 4,400 people a day.  The Government is for solving the issue as the pollution has reached a dreadful level. China’s premier Li Keqiang said, “We will consolidate the gains made in the fight to defend our blue skies”.  The Chinese government has promised to decrease the amount of pollution by 50 percent in five years.
        In 2014 the Government of China “declared war” on air pollution.  In that year they strived to shut down 50,000 coal-burning facilities in the country.  The government is trying to collect 10 percent of their energy from solar means, but the heavy smog makes the panels a lot less effective than they should be.  Instead, the government should work on wind energy.  China has a long coastline, they should install wind turbines on the sea where the wind is not restricted.  The energy source would   be close to the energy deficient east coast where it is needed the most.  Then the powerful Three Gorges Dam would not need to transport its energy so far and less of the power would be lost in transportation.
