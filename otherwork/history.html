        <p>In modern nations, especially ones that have massive populations, they must generate power for all of their citizens. In our countries, coal and other fossil fuels burning is the method used, due to cheap cost. Many people have different perspectives about clean energy. The American government for instance has its two main parties split on global warming and renewable energy. Republican president of the U.S.A says “ Our energy companies are a disaster right now. Coal. The coal business is — you know, there is such a thing as clean coal”. Hillary Clinton a democrat says,  As president, I'll set bold goals to combat climate change: generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years and slash carbon pollution at home and around the world. The switch to clean energy is especially hard when people can't agree on what to do about it.
        However, they haven’t taken into consideration the negative effects on the environment.
        China, India, and the USA have some of the fastest growing populations in the world, so naturally, coal burning has increased because cheap energy is needed to fuel the population. Of course, All of these countries have a history of pollution. The US first starting burning fossil fuels in the industrial revolution, over 200 years ago.  China first started in 1960, and India started at the same time as the US. However, the huge population growth has caused this to rise. This rapid influx of fossil fuel burning has been catastrophic to the air quality of these countries. For example, in Delhi, the quality of the air has plummeted in the past decade, and the population only continues to grow. Meanwhile, in America, the use of unsustainable power such as oil has increased exponentially. Despite making up barely 6% of the population, they use more than 20% of the world’s oil. They also have one of the highest consumptions of oil in the world, consuming 19.88 million barrels of petroleum products a DAY. The problem in China is kind of similar to India’s. They both have catastrophically bad air pollution. In some industrial parts of China, the air pollution is so bad that you need a mask to breathe. Of course, with China’s massive population, it’s not surprising that they are one of the most polluted countries in the world. Their air pollution problem arose from all the coal that they burned trying to support their insanely big population.
        There have been lots of natural disasters caused by global warming which is a direct result of nations using unsustained energy and in some cases people not having sustainable energy. it is a problem because global warming will affect us drastically in the very near future. In about 40 years the weather will turn extreme and in the years following tons of natural disasters will follow. The U.S spent around 306 billion on natural disasters in 2017.
        The Use of unsustainable energy is beginning to take its toll and if we don’t help to use more clean energy that is affordable for almost everyone we will have to spend billions on the consequences.
        As president, I'll set bold goals to combat climate change: generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years and slash carbon pollution at home and around the world.</p>
