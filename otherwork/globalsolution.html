        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>	Our global solution is to place wind turbines in open areas of the sea and unused plots of land like plateaus.  A single onshore wind turbine can power over 1500 homes in the European Union, offshore can produce even more wind energy.  With China’s long coastline there would be may places to put offshore wind farms.  Which would be great since the heavily populated east coast of China is where the most energy is needed.  Also wind farms could be built on plateaus where they could supply a lot of energy people nearby without the need to transport energy long distances.  Onshore wind farms could also work for developing countries in Africa where the energy could be generated on site and delivered to homes nearby.  The first offshore wind turbine farm was in Denmark in 1991. Offshore wind farms generate more energy than normal ones, but cost significantly more and wont be able to compete with fossil fuels until 2026. However the costs have been falling rapidly and energy capacity has been getting better.  A couple challenges to our idea could be transporting the power back to the mainland and the turbines getting damaged from storms or rouge ships.  Another issue could be to convince people to use this source of energy over fossil fuels as the effects on the ecosystem are not known yet so we might have to deal with wildlife activists and conduct more experiments about wind turbines at sea.  Our solution would positively affect our issue because wind power is the most powerful renewable source of power.  By putting these turbines in the oceans, we will generate a lot of clean energy for many countries, reducing the need for fossil fuels.
